                            <p>Fr. Bernard Rabwoni Akiiki, a Catholic priest of Fort Portal Diocese, ordained on 30th June 2018. His own journey through hardship and determination inspired him to create opportunities for others.</p>

                                "I was always very interested in going to school because I wanted to become a priest or a lawyer. But school was more than 10 kilometers away. I walked this distance barefoot, and we had no proper buildings—just trees for classrooms. Despite poverty and many challenges, I was able to study up to PhD level. That’s why I founded this school." – Fr. Bernard

                        <h2>The Journey</h2>
                        <p>Growing up in rural western Uganda, Fr. Bernard witnessed firsthand the struggles children face in accessing education. After becoming a priest, he was determined to make a difference. <br>
He purchased land in Kasenene, a village in Kyegegwa District, one of Uganda's poorest regions, and began the school with makeshift wooden classrooms. The goal was clear: to build a low-cost, community school where even the poorest children could receive quality education close to home.
                        </p>

                            Cause of Our Joy Junior School - Kasenene is a nursery and primary school located in western Uganda. The school was established to provide accessible, affordable education for children in Kasenene and surrounding villages, where schools were previously more than 5 to 10 kilometers away.

                        <p>
                           The school serves children from nursery to primary level, and aims to offer more than just academics—it strives to be a nurturing space where children grow in character, faith, and confidence.
